**What?** Space in memory where a value is stored that changes during program execution.
**Why?** Because when creating a program, there is a need to store values  to use later.
**How?** The type of data that can be stored + The name of the variable. Then, the variable can be initialized  by assigning it a value. When a variable is declared, it reserves space for that type of value in RAM.
